# Write a function that, given the dataset and the ID of an individual in the dataset, 
# returns their earliest known ancestor â€“ the one at the farthest distance from the input
# individual. If there is more than one ancestor tied for "earliest", return the one 
# with the lowest numeric ID. If the input individual has no parents, the function should 
# return -1.

# Pseudocode
# instantiate graph, add vertices/nodes to graph
# add edges to graph, child -> parent direction
# instantiate queue, add a path from the starting node to queue
# instantiate set
# while queue not empty, dequeue 1st path
# grab last vertex from path

# actually i can avoid all of this with recursive implementaiton and adding another input
